# Methodology

## **Main steps of our testing process**

1. Note hardware platform (desktop/laptop/handheld) and drive specifications before commencing the benchmarks.
2. Update the drive firmware to latest version if possible (for example, using [Samsung Magician](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/) for Samsung SSDs).
3. In case of portable hardware platform (laptop/handheld/tablet), connect the device to charger and remain connected until the tests are complete.
4. Take the hardware platform (PC/laptop/handheld) fully offline and remain offline until the benchmarks are completed.
5. Disable all the startup apps and perform a fresh reboot of the device.
6. Perform synthetic benchmarks (CrystalDiskMark, Samsung Magician etc.) and ensure a one-hour break and a reboot between each test. Each test is performed at least twice to ensure consistency.
7. Then perform real world tests (more discussed below), ensuring similar one hour break and a reboot between each test.

## More about real world tests
<p>
Peak speeds of modern SSDs can range from <1GB/s to 7GB/s (even higher for some models). However, real-world tests often reveal that several SSDs fail to maintain their peak speeds and operate at slower rates. To get an idea of their real-world performance, we will perform the following tests:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy a 10GB 4K video.
</li>
<li>Copy a 25GB 4K video.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The videos will be located in the Documents folder (Windows 10 or 11) and copied to the desktop. We will note down the start and end times of each copy operation. Each test will be repeated three times, and the average time will be calculated.

More tests will be added later.

While we thoroughly test everything, some errors may have unintentionally occurred. Therefore, we cannot offer an absolute guarantee of accuracy in our results.
